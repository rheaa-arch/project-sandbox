# project-sandbox
A collection of SQL practice problems and projects — from learning basics to real-world datasets.

## SQLBolt Practice

Each file in this folder contains my SQL solutions to the SQLBolt lessons.

### Sample Tables Used
These queries use SQLBolt’s sample tables (not included here), such as:
- **employees** – columns: id, name, age, department, salary
- **orders** – columns: order_id, customer_id, amount, date
- **customers** – columns: customer_id, name, city, state

### Notes
The focus is on query logic — table data is simulated, not real.
